# Automated D&D Character Sheet
A program that will generate as much of a character sheet as possible with minimal input from the user. The purpose is narrow the gap of entry for new D&amp;D players.

Feel free to use this program however you please with exception of adding or attaching to a GUI.

I am working on this program as a resume builder. I will look at suggestions, but I will not use anyone else's code.

I am working on the functionality of the program before I work on the GUI which I plan to implement with QT.

Read "CHANGE LOG.md" for changes between version and anything known issues.
